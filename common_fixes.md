# Common Fixes & Pitfalls

## `+C` flags crash BEAM silently on Android (exit(1), no logcat output)

**Symptom**: App exits cleanly with code 1 within ~60ms of `erl_start`. No Erlang code
runs (no diagnostic files written). BEAM stderr goes to `/dev/null` on Android, so no
error message is visible in logcat. The last logcat line is the symlink logs from
`mob_start_beam`.

**Root cause**: `erl_start` is called directly (bypassing `erlexec`). The BEAM arg
parser in `erl_start` requires all emulator flags to start with `-`. Any `+`-prefixed
arg (e.g. `+C multi_time_warp`) hits:

```c
if (argv[i][0] != '-') erts_usage();   // → exit(1) with no output
```

`erlexec` normally translates `+` flags to `-` before passing them to the BEAM, but
mob_beam.c calls `erl_start` directly.

**Fix**: Use `-C multi_time_warp` instead of `+C multi_time_warp`. Or omit it entirely
— `multi_time_warp` is already the default in OTP 28 (erts-16.3).

**Fixed in**: `mob/android/jni/mob_beam.c` — removed `"+C", "multi_time_warp"` from
`BEAM_EXTRA_FLAGS` (2026-04-14).

## Android BEAM stderr is silent

All ERTS error output (arg parse errors, boot failures, `erts_usage()`) goes to fd 2
(stderr). On Android, stderr from JNI threads goes to `/dev/null`, not logcat.

To capture BEAM stderr for diagnosis, redirect fd 2 to a file before calling
`erl_start`:

```c
char stderr_log[580];
snprintf(stderr_log, sizeof(stderr_log), "%s/beam_stderr.log", s_files_dir);
int fd = open(stderr_log, O_CREAT | O_WRONLY | O_TRUNC, 0644);
if (fd >= 0) { dup2(fd, STDERR_FILENO); close(fd); }
```

Then after crash: `adb shell "run-as com.mob.demo cat /data/user/0/com.mob.demo/files/beam_stderr.log"`

## iOS BEAM crashes with `eaddrinuse` when Android is also connected

**Symptom**: iOS simulator app exits immediately. `xcrun simctl launch --console` shows:
`Protocol 'inet_tcp': register/listen error: eaddrinuse`

**Root cause**: `mob_beam.m` defaults to dist port 9100 when `MOB_DIST_PORT` is not set.
When an Android device is connected, `adb forward tcp:9100 tcp:9100` is active and holds
port 9100 on localhost. The iOS BEAM tries to bind the same port for Erlang distribution
and fails.

**Fix**: Default iOS dist port changed from 9100 → 9101 in `mob/ios/mob_beam.m`.
Per the port assignment scheme: Android = 9100, iOS sim = 9101.
Requires a native rebuild (`mix mob.deploy --native --ios`).

**Fixed in**: `mob/ios/mob_beam.m` (2026-04-14).

## Dashboard LiveView crash: `process_keyed/5 ArgumentError`

**Symptom**: `mob_dev` Phoenix LiveView server crashes with `ArgumentError` in
`Phoenix.LiveView.Diff.process_keyed/5` during rapid log ingestion.

**Root causes (three separate issues)**:
1. `phx-update="stream"` and `phx-hook="ScrollBottom"` on the **same** element — explicitly
   prohibited by LiveView. Hook must be on an outer wrapper; stream on an inner element.
2. Variable name collision: loop variable `line` used in both deploy output `:for` and
   the stream `:for` iterator.
3. Double `:if` directives inside stream items — use `<%= if %>...<% else %>...<% end %>`
   instead.

**Fixed in**: `mob_dev/lib/mob_dev/server/live/dashboard_live.ex` — converted log list
to a Phoenix stream, separated hook/stream elements, renamed loop variable.

---

## `mix mob.deploy` silently skips updating BEAM files

**Symptom**: `mix mob.deploy --ios` reports "Pushing N BEAM file(s) ✓" but the deployed
beams in `/tmp/otp-ios-sim/<app>/` retain old timestamps and old content (e.g. `mob_nif.beam`
missing `log/2` export even after force-recompiling the dep).

**Root cause**: `Deployer.deploy_ios/3` runs `System.cmd("cp", ["-r", "#{dir}/.", dest])`
where `dir` is a relative path like `_build/dev/lib/mob_demo/ebin`. `System.cmd` spawns an
OS subprocess that uses the **OS process CWD**, not the Erlang process CWD. Mix sets the
Erlang CWD to the project root via `:file.set_cwd`, but this doesn't affect the OS CWD of
spawned subprocesses. If the two differ (e.g. because Mix compiled a dep in a sub-directory),
the relative path resolves to the wrong location and `cp` silently exits 0 with no matching
source files.

**Fix**: Use `Path.expand(dir)` before passing to `System.cmd`, which resolves the relative
path against `File.cwd!()` (the Erlang process CWD, correctly set to the project root).

**Fixed in**: `mob_dev/lib/mob_dev/deployer.ex` — both `deploy_ios/3` and
`push_beams_android/2` now use `Path.expand(dir)` (2026-04-14).

## Android crash: OTP spawns local `epmd` that conflicts with ADB reverse tunnel

**Symptom**: Distribution fails or crashes when `mix mob.connect` is active. OTP's
`Node.start/2` tries to spawn a local `epmd` that also binds port 4369, conflicting
with the ADB reverse tunnel listener (`adb reverse tcp:4369 tcp:4369`).

**Root cause**: `mix mob.connect` runs `adb reverse tcp:4369 tcp:4369`, which creates a
listener on device port 4369 forwarded to Mac EPMD. When `Node.start/2` is called, OTP
attempts to spawn a local `epmd` daemon that also tries to bind port 4369 — conflicting
with the ADB listener.

**Fix**: Set `:kernel` env `start_epmd: false` before calling `Node.start/2`, which
prevents OTP from spawning a local EPMD. Additionally, poll port 4369 before starting
distribution — if the ADB tunnel isn't up (standalone launch, no `mix mob.connect`),
skip distribution entirely rather than crashing. Timeout is 10 seconds.

The polling also acts as a synchronization barrier: distribution only starts once the Mac
EPMD is actually reachable, eliminating the timing race.

If no EPMD appears within 10s, `Mob.Dist` logs:
`"Mob.Dist: no EPMD on port 4369 after 10s — skipping dist (run mix mob.connect to enable)"`

**Fixed in**: `mob/lib/mob/dist.ex` — `start_after/4` now calls `wait_for_epmd/1` and
sets `start_epmd: false` before `Node.start/2` (2026-04-15).

## Android BEAM crashes every time after first deploy — `mix mob.connect` missing chcon

**Symptom**: App works on first `mix mob.deploy` but crashes every subsequent time
`mix mob.connect` relaunches it. Logcat shows:

```
E MobBeam: mob_start_beam: symlink erl_child_setup failed: Permission denied
E MobBeam: mob_start_beam: symlink inet_gethost failed: Permission denied
E MobBeam: mob_start_beam: symlink epmd failed: Permission denied
W beam-main: avc: denied { search } scontext=u:r:untrusted_app:s0:c19,...
                                    tcontext=u:object_r:app_data_file:s0:c2,...
```

And `files/erl_crash.dump` contains:
```
Slogan: Runtime terminating during boot ({undef,[{mob_demo,start,[],[]}, ...]})
```

Or a SIGABRT tombstone from inside `mob_start_beam`/`erl_start`.

**Root cause (two-part)**:

1. **SELinux MCS mismatch**: When the APK is installed/reinstalled, Android assigns the
   package a pair of MCS categories (e.g. `c19,c257,c512,c768`). Files in `files/otp/`
   pushed via `adb push` retain whatever category they had at push time (e.g. `c2`). The
   app process runs with `c19` but the OTP directory has `c2` → SELinux denies access →
   symlink creation fails → `erl_start` calls `abort()` → SIGABRT.
   `mix mob.deploy` runs `chcon` to fix this, but `mix mob.connect` (which calls
   `Android.restart_app`) did NOT run `chcon` before `am start`.

2. **Missing `mob_demo/` BEAMs**: If only `mix mob.connect` (not `mix mob.deploy`) was
   run, the app BEAM files in `files/otp/mob_demo/` may not exist. The BEAM starts but
   `mob_demo:start()` is `undef` → clean OTP exit (not a crash signal, no auto-restart).

**Fix**: Added `chcon -R $(stat -c %C .../files) .../files/otp` to `Android.restart_app`
in `mob_dev/lib/mob_dev/discovery/android.ex`. Now both `mob.deploy` and `mob.connect`
heal the SELinux labels before starting the app.

**Fixed in**: `mob_dev/lib/mob_dev/discovery/android.ex` — `restart_app/4` now runs
`chcon` before `am start` (2026-04-15).

---

## Android symlink permission denied after APK reinstall

**Symptom**: App crashes on every launch after reinstalling the APK. Logcat shows:

```
E MobBeam: mob_start_beam: symlink erl_child_setup failed: Permission denied
E MobBeam: mob_start_beam: symlink inet_gethost failed: Permission denied
E MobBeam: mob_start_beam: symlink epmd failed: Permission denied
```

The BEAM never starts. The app appears to open but immediately goes blank.

**Root cause**: Android assigns each app a pair of SELinux MCS categories (e.g.
`c9,c257,c512,c768`). These are embedded in the labels on the app's data directory
by `installd` at install time. When an APK is reinstalled, Android may assign a *new*
category pair. Files already present in the data directory (pushed by `adb push`) retain
their old categories. The process then can't access files labeled with a different category —
SELinux MCS isolation blocks it even though both use the `app_data_file` type.

Diagnosis — compare the process category with the file category:
```
# App's current category (from parent dir, always correct):
adb shell ls -laZ /data/user/0/com.mob.demo/

# OTP files' category (may be stale):
adb shell ls -laZ /data/user/0/com.mob.demo/files/otp/erts-16.3/bin/erl_child_setup
```
A mismatch in the first MCS number (e.g. `c9` vs `c2`) is the tell.

**Why `restorecon` doesn't fix it**: `restorecon` only restores the *type label*
(`app_data_file`). MCS categories are not part of the file_contexts policy — they are
set per-package by `installd` and `restorecon` leaves them unchanged.

**Fix**: Use `chcon` to copy the correct context from the app's own `files/` directory
(which `installd` always keeps correctly labeled) to the OTP tree:

```bash
# One-liner on device:
chcon -R $(stat -c %C /data/user/0/com.mob.demo/files) /data/user/0/com.mob.demo/files/otp
```

In the deployer, this runs automatically via `restart_android` (before `am start`) and
`push_beams_android` (after `adb push`).

**Fixed in**: `mob_dev/lib/mob_dev/deployer.ex` — replaced both `restorecon` calls with
`chcon -R $(stat -c %C <files_dir>) <otp_dir>` (2026-04-15).

## `mix mob.deploy` code pushed but screen didn't update (dist hot-load needs re-render trigger)

**Symptom**: `mix mob.deploy` reports `✓ (dist, no restart)` — code was pushed, no error —
but the running app looks unchanged. Tapping a button or navigating away and back causes
the new code to appear.

**Root cause**: Erlang hot code loading (`code:load_binary`) replaces the module in the
code server immediately, but does **not** cause any running process to re-execute. The
`Mob.Screen` GenServer is sitting in its receive loop waiting for the next message. Until
something sends it a message, `render/1` is never called again — so the display stays as-is
even though the new code is live in memory. This is standard Erlang behaviour, not a bug in
the BEAM, but it's non-obvious when you expect to see visual feedback immediately.

The condition for this to occur: the iOS app is running with Erlang distribution active
(which it always is after `mix mob.deploy --native`). iOS shares the Mac's network stack, so
`mob_dev` can connect to the device node without any tunnel setup. When it connects, it
prefers the dist hot-load path over the filesystem + restart path.

Android is not affected by this issue in the same way — the Android dist path requires adb
tunnels that the deployer doesn't set up, so Android always falls through to the filesystem
push + restart path.

**Fix**: After a successful dist push, `mob_dev` now sends `:__mob_hot_reload__` to the
`:mob_screen` registered process on the device via `:rpc.call`:

```elixir
:rpc.call(node, :erlang, :send, [:mob_screen, :__mob_hot_reload__])
```

`Mob.Screen`'s `handle_info` catch-all receives it, delegates to the user module (which
ignores unknown messages), then calls `do_render/2` with the current version of the screen
module. The screen repaints immediately with no restart and no loss of GenServer state.

**Fixed in**: `mob_dev/lib/mob_dev/deployer.ex` — `push_via_dist/2` now sends the
re-render message after `HotPush.push_all/1` (2026-04-21).

## Android "screen wipe" when backgrounding / resuming the app

**Symptom**: When the app is backgrounded and then resumed, the screen briefly goes
black or white (a "wipe") for 1–2 frames before the UI reappears. The app content
visually disappears and snaps back.

**Root causes (two separate issues)**:

1. **`Theme.NoTitleBar` white `windowBackground`**: The default system theme has a white
   `windowBackground`. Android briefly shows the window background during the 1–2 frame
   gap between recreating the window surface and Compose drawing the first frame on resume.
   With a white background the flash is highly visible. Changing it to black makes it
   imperceptible (matches the app's dark default background).

2. **Missing `android:configChanges`**: Without this, any system configuration change
   (rotation, font scale, display density, keyboard availability, etc.) destroys and
   recreates the Activity. This calls `nativeStartBeam()` a second time on an already-
   running BEAM — undefined behavior (likely crash or silent second BEAM instance).
   Declaring all expected config changes prevents Activity recreation entirely; Compose
   handles them in-process.

**Fix**:

1. Create `app/src/main/res/values/styles.xml`:
   ```xml
   <style name="AppTheme" parent="android:style/Theme.NoTitleBar">
       <item name="android:windowBackground">@android:color/black</item>
       <item name="android:windowAnimationStyle">@null</item>
       <item name="android:windowNoTitle">true</item>
   </style>
   ```
   (`windowAnimationStyle` is cleared so system window open/close slide animations
   don't fight Compose's own nav transitions.)

2. In `AndroidManifest.xml`:
   - Change `android:theme` on `<application>` from `@android:style/Theme.NoTitleBar`
     to `@style/AppTheme`
   - Add to `<activity>`:
     ```
     android:configChanges="orientation|screenSize|screenLayout|keyboard|keyboardHidden|navigation|uiMode|fontScale|density"
     ```

**Fixed in**: `mob_demo/android/app/src/main/res/values/styles.xml` (created) and
`mob_demo/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` — theme + configChanges (2026-04-15).

## iOS BEAM crashes when `Mob.Test.pop` / `pop_to_root` is called via distribution

**Symptom**: `Mob.Test.pop(node)`, `Mob.Test.pop_to(node, ...)`, or
`Mob.Test.pop_to_root(node)` causes the iOS node to crash immediately. The node
goes offline; `Node.list/0` no longer shows it.

**Root cause**: The pop NIFs (`nif_nav_pop`, `nif_nav_pop_to_root`) mutate the
SwiftUI `NavigationPath` from the Erlang distribution thread. SwiftUI requires all
state mutations to happen on the main thread. The push path runs on the main thread
(guarded by a `DispatchQueue.main.async` block); the pop path does not.

**Status**: Not yet fixed. Push navigation (`navigate/3`) is safe.

**Workaround**:
- Use `Mob.Test.navigate(node, SomeScreen)` to drive the app forward instead of back.
- Drive backward navigation via native UI tap using the MCP simulator tools
  (`mcp__ios_simulator__ui_tap` on the Back button) rather than `Mob.Test.pop`.
- In automated tests, structure flows so pop is unnecessary — navigate forward to
  reset state, or restart the app.

## arm32 Android OTP: `asn1rt_nif.a` not built by cross-compile

**Symptom**: CMake/ninja build fails with:

```
ninja: error: '.../erts-16.3/lib/asn1rt_nif.a', needed by 'libsmoketest.so', missing
```

Only happens for `armeabi-v7a` (arm32) targets. arm64 and iOS builds are unaffected.

**Root cause**: OTP's build system emits `asn1rt_nif.a` for arm64 and iOS cross-compile
targets but silently skips it for arm32 (`arm-unknown-linux-androideabi`). The static
NIF table in `driver_tab_android.c` references the symbol `asn1rt_nif_nif_init`, which
must come from this library.

**Critical detail**: The file must be compiled with `-DSTATIC_ERLANG_NIF_LIBNAME=asn1rt_nif`.
Without this flag the init symbol is `nif_init`, not `asn1rt_nif_nif_init`, and the linker
will fail with an undefined symbol at link time even though the `.a` file exists.

**Fix**: Compile manually and place at `erts-<vsn>/lib/asn1rt_nif.a` in the tarball:

```bash
NDK=~/Library/Android/sdk/ndk/27.2.12479018/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/darwin-x86_64/bin
OTP_SRC=~/code/otp

$NDK/armv7a-linux-androideabi21-clang \
  -march=armv7-a -mfloat-abi=softfp -mthumb \
  -fvisibility=hidden -fno-common -fno-strict-aliasing \
  -fstack-protector-strong -O2 \
  -I "$OTP_SRC/erts/arm-unknown-linux-androideabi" \
  -I "$OTP_SRC/erts/include/arm-unknown-linux-androideabi" \
  -I "$OTP_SRC/erts/emulator/beam" \
  -I "$OTP_SRC/erts/include" \
  -DHAVE_CONFIG_H \
  -DSTATIC_ERLANG_NIF_LIBNAME=asn1rt_nif \
  -c "$OTP_SRC/lib/asn1/c_src/asn1_erl_nif.c" \
  -o /tmp/asn1rt_nif_arm32.o

$NDK/llvm-ar rc /tmp/asn1rt_nif_arm32.a /tmp/asn1rt_nif_arm32.o
$NDK/llvm-ranlib /tmp/asn1rt_nif_arm32.a
```

**Fixed in**: `mob_dev/build_release.md` — documents the arm32 compilation requirement
and the correct compile command (2026-04-25).

## macOS `tar` inserts `._` Apple Double sidecar files into archives

**Symptom**: When pushing OTP or BEAM files to an Android device, Toybox tar on the
device prints a stream of errors like:

```
tar: chown 501:20 '._.': Operation not permitted
tar: chown 501:20 '._liberl_child_setup.so': Operation not permitted
```

The `._<filename>` entries are macOS Apple Double metadata files that macOS `tar`
silently inserts into archives. On Android, Toybox tar tries to restore the macOS
owner (UID 501, GID 20) and fails because the device doesn't have those users.

**Root cause**: macOS `tar` writes AppleDouble sidecar files by default when archiving
on HFS+/APFS. The environment variable `COPYFILE_DISABLE=1` disables this behaviour.

**Fix**: Set `COPYFILE_DISABLE=1` in the environment of every macOS `tar` create call:

```elixir
System.cmd("tar", ["czf", out, ...], env: [{"COPYFILE_DISABLE", "1"}])
```

**Fixed in**: `mob_dev/lib/mob_dev/deployer.ex` and `mob_dev/lib/mob_dev/native_build.ex`
— all `tar` archive creation calls now pass `env: [{"COPYFILE_DISABLE", "1"}]` (2026-04-25).

---

## Toybox tar on Android 10 exits 1 on chown failure even when extraction succeeds

**Symptom**: `run-as <pkg> tar xf ...` exits with code 1, causing `mob_dev` to report
an error. But the files are actually present and intact on the device.

**Root cause**: Android 10 ships Toybox tar (not GNU tar). Toybox tar exits 1 when it
cannot restore file ownership from the archive, even if all files were extracted
correctly. Archives created on macOS embed owner UID 501 / GID 20; the `run-as`
sandbox cannot `chown` to those values, so every file triggers a non-fatal error that
still sets the exit code to 1.

**Fix**: Append `2>/dev/null; true` to all device-side extraction commands so the
non-zero exit code and stderr noise are suppressed:

```elixir
adb.(["shell", "run-as #{bundle_id} sh -c 'tar xf ... 2>/dev/null; true'"])
```

**Fixed in**: `mob_dev/lib/mob_dev/deployer.ex` and `mob_dev/lib/mob_dev/native_build.ex`
— all device-side `tar xf` invocations now append `2>/dev/null; true` (2026-04-25).

---

## Toybox tar on Android 10 does not support `--strip-components`

**Symptom**: OTP or BEAM push fails with:

```
run-as tar failed: tar: Unknown option strip-components=1
```

**Root cause**: GNU tar's `--strip-components=N` flag strips leading path components
during extraction. Toybox tar (shipped on Android 10 and some Android 11 devices) does
not implement this flag.

**Fix**: Change the archive structure so no stripping is needed. Instead of archiving a
named wrapper directory and stripping it on extraction, archive the contents directly:

```bash
# Instead of:
tar czf archive.tar.gz -C /parent wrapper_dir/    # extracts as wrapper_dir/file
# Use:
tar czf archive.tar.gz -C /parent/wrapper_dir .   # extracts as ./file
```

On the device side, simply `tar xf archive.tar.gz` with no `--strip-components`.

**Fixed in**: `mob_dev/lib/mob_dev/deployer.ex` — `push_beams_android_runas/2` changed
archive creation to `tar cf -C tmp_dir .` (2026-04-25).

---

## `mob.exs` bundle_id mismatch silently skips OTP push

**Symptom**: `mix mob.deploy` completes without error but the app crashes on launch.
The deploy log shows:

```
⚠ ZY22CRLMWK: com.mob.mobqa not installed — skipping OTP push
```

The OTP runtime is never pushed to the device, so the BEAM starts but can't find the
app module. `erl_crash.dump` on the device contains:

```
Slogan: {undef,[{smoke_test,start,[],[]}]}
```

**Root cause**: `mob.exs` contains a `bundle_id` that doesn't match the package name
in `android/app/build.gradle`. The deployer checks for the installed package using
`pm list packages <bundle_id>` before pushing OTP. If the IDs don't match, it skips
the push with a warning rather than failing hard.

`mob.exs` is gitignored and machine-specific. It's easy for it to drift from the
project's actual bundle ID, especially when the same file was copied from another
project.

**Fix**: Ensure `bundle_id` in `mob.exs` exactly matches `applicationId` in
`android/app/build.gradle`.

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# What mob.exs thinks the bundle ID is:
grep bundle_id mob.exs

# What the APK actually uses:
grep applicationId android/app/build.gradle
```
