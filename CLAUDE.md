# Mob — Agent Instructions

## Standard debugging workflow

The preferred tool is `mix mob.connect` (from `mob_dev` package):

```bash
cd ~/code/mob_demo
mix mob.connect          # discover all devices, tunnel, restart, connect IEx
mix mob.connect --no-iex # same but print node names instead of starting IEx
mix mob.devices          # list connected devices and their status
```

Node names are platform-specific:
- iOS simulator:    `mob_demo_ios@127.0.0.1`
- Android emulator: `mob_demo_android@127.0.0.1`

### EPMD tunneling

iOS simulator shares the Mac's network stack — the iOS BEAM registers directly in
the Mac's EPMD on port 4369. No forwarding needed.

Android is a separate network namespace. `mob_dev` sets up adb tunnels automatically:

```
adb reverse tcp:4369 tcp:4369   # EPMD: device → Mac (Android BEAM registers in Mac EPMD)
adb forward tcp:9100 tcp:9100   # dist:  Mac → device
```

### Port assignment (handled by mob_dev)

Devices are assigned dist ports by index to avoid conflicts:
- Device 0 (Android): port 9100
- Device 1 (iOS sim): port 9101

iOS dist port is passed via `SIMCTL_CHILD_MOB_DIST_PORT` env var; `mob_beam.m` reads
`MOB_DIST_PORT` at startup. Android dist port is passed as an intent extra (`mob_dist_port`);
**`MainActivity.java` does NOT yet read this — multi-Android support is pending.**

Both iOS and Android end up registered in the same Mac EPMD. `mix mob.connect` sets
up all tunnels automatically.

## Day-to-day development loop

```bash
# Edit Elixir code, then:
mix mob.deploy          # compile + push BEAMs + restart apps
mix mob.connect         # tunnel + wait for nodes + drop into IEx

# In IEx (after mob.connect):
mix compile && nl(MobDemo.CounterScreen)   # hot-push one module without restart
Node.list()                                # verify both devices connected
:rpc.call(:"mob_demo_android@127.0.0.1", MobDemo.CounterScreen, :some_fn, [])
```

### Reading live screen state

```elixir
# Screen pid is logged at app start: "[mob] step 5 => {ok,<0.92.0>}"
pid = :rpc.call(:"mob_demo_android@127.0.0.1", :erlang, :list_to_pid, [~c"<0.92.0>"])
socket = :rpc.call(:"mob_demo_android@127.0.0.1", Mob.Screen, :get_socket, [pid])
socket.assigns   # live assigns
```

### Hot code push

```elixir
# After editing a screen:
mix compile && nl(MobDemo.CounterScreen)
# Returns: {:ok, [{:"mob_demo@127.0.0.1", :loaded, MobDemo.CounterScreen}]}
```

### Android distribution

Android cannot start distribution at BEAM launch (races with hwui thread pool, causes
SIGABRT via FORTIFY `pthread_mutex_lock on destroyed mutex`). Instead, `Mob.Dist.ensure_started/1`
defers `Node.start/2` by 3 seconds after app startup. This is handled in the mob library —
app code just calls `Mob.Dist.ensure_started(node: :"my_app_android@127.0.0.1", cookie: :my_secret)`.

ERTS helper binaries (`erl_child_setup`, `inet_gethost`, `epmd`) cannot be exec'd from the
app data directory (SELinux `app_data_file` blocks `execute_no_trans`). They are packaged in
the APK as `lib*.so` in `jniLibs/arm64-v8a/` (gets `apk_data_file` label, which allows exec).
`mob_beam.c` symlinks `BINDIR/<name>` → `<nativeLibraryDir>/lib<name>.so` before `erl_start`.

## Device automation with Mob.Test

After connecting via `mix mob.connect`, use `Mob.Test` to inspect and drive the
running app without touching the native UI. Prefer this over screenshot-based
inspection — it gives exact state, not a visual approximation.

```elixir
node = :"mob_demo_ios@127.0.0.1"   # or mob_demo_android@127.0.0.1

# What screen is showing and what state is it in?
Mob.Test.screen(node)    #=> MobDemo.NavScreen
Mob.Test.assigns(node)   #=> %{depth: 0, safe_area: %{top: 62.0, ...}}

# Find a node by visible text
Mob.Test.find(node, "Device APIs")
#=> [{[0, 0, 9], %{"type" => "button", ...}}]

# Trigger a tap by the tag atom used in on_tap: {self(), tag}
Mob.Test.tap(node, :open_device)

# Full snapshot for debugging
Mob.Test.inspect(node)
# %{screen: MobDemo.NavScreen, assigns: ..., nav_history: [...], tree: ...}
```

Tag atoms come from `on_tap: {self(), :tag_atom}` in the render tree. Check the
screen's `render/1` to find them. After a tap, call `Mob.Test.screen/1` again to
confirm the navigation happened.

## Running tests

```bash
mix test          # from ~/code/mob
```
